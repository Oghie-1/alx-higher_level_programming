Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

Scripting (same as we did with Python)
Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.


Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
You must use console.log(...) to print all output
You are not allowed to use var
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$ ./0-javascript_is_amazing.js 
JavaScript is amazing
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x12$ semistandard ./0-javascript_is_amazing.js
